1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,310
The next version we'll look at is get dif head, so this will list all changes in our working directory

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,430
since the last commit since hit, right.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,920
Remember Head is this pointer, this reference to the last commit, typically the last comment on a

4 
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,340
branch.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,940
So whoever head is, when we do get ahead, we'll see the changes that we've made since head.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,880
So that includes if we try this again here, get dif head.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,160
That includes staged and unstaged changes.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,280
So right now, you know, we see the same exact output that we saw when I just did regular get diff.

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,310
This is showing all unstaged changes.

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,330
This is showing everything that has changed since our last commit since head.

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,480
However, if I stage something, if I do get add in, then our file is called what colors that text.

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,960
If I do get diff again now we don't see any changes.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,640
Nothing is showing up because this is supposed to show me the difference between my working directory

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,660
and the staging area.

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,160
And right now they're the same.

16
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,880
But if I do get diff head, this is showing me the difference between the head and my working directory.

17
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,370
So now we see the same thing we were seeing earlier.

18
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,410
So now let's go ahead and commit.

19
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,080
So get commit desch and just add Indigo and then I'm going to do something different.

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,930
Now I'm going to make what should I do?

21
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,350
I guess I'll make a new file and this new file will be called.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,270
It doesn't really matter, but it will be numbers.

23
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:30,900
All right.

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,720
So touch numbers, dot text.

25
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:41,640
And in this numbers file, I'm just going to add the number one to begin with, so I'll just spell it

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,750
out in all caps one.

27
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,320
OK, so currently numbers is untracked.

28
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,650
So if I try and do get diff, I'm going to see anything there.

29
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:56,080
However, if I add that new change, so get add numbers text.

30
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,570
Now if I do get diff head we see that since our last commis we have some new stuff.

31
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:03,930
Right.

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,160
And it's just the fact that numbers that text now exists and it has this line one inside of it, the

33
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,940
way that we can tell that there was nothing there before the version A is actually dev null.

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:24,030
That's gets way of telling us nothing compared to now having the file numbers.

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,520
So there is nothing really to compare it before, but that doesn't break it.

36
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,670
We just end up seeing only the additions because there only are additions.

37
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,360
OK, so get Dev, head shows us that, but just one more time.

38
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,470
Get diff on its own.

39
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,720
It's only showing us unstaged changes.

40
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,140
Nothing has been there, nothing is currently unstaged.

41
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:51,300
But if I add Vialet for example, two colors and I do get diff, we only see a diff for colors because

42
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,090
that's the only file that changed that has not been staged versus get diff head.

43
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,200
I just remind you here, numbers is staged, colors is not.

44
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:07,410
So if I do get Dev head, I see all changes staged on stage.

45
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:07,980
It doesn't matter.

46
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:16,110
Anything new in the working directory since head right and head if you ever forget and head currently

47
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,940
is pointing to this comment here.

48
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,610
So that's what we are comparing to.

49
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:28,170
So get Dev shows us all unstaged changes, get dev head shows us all changes staged and unstaged since

50
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,560
head.
