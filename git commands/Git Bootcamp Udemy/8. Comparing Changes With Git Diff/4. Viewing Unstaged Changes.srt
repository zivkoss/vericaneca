1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,160
All right, so now we're going to walk through some of the different ways of using get dif, we've got

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:11,940
get diff, get dif head, get dif staged and cached and then we have get dev head with a file name,

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,550
get diff staged with a file name, branch names that we can use if we can commit hashes in there.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,500
So there's a lot that we can cover.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,340
It all follows a very similar pattern though, so it's not super difficult.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,340
But I'm going to begin by making a very basic repo that we can follow along with instead of this crazy

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:28,710
one.

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,310
Right.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,930
With all these changes and tons of files, I'm going to do just a trivial example.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,210
It all works the same way.

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,470
So I'm not in a repo at the moment.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,320
I'll admit to repo and I'm going to make a colores file colors, dot text.

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,260
And why not add a commit right now.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,530
Get add colors, dot text, get commit.

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,550
We'll just do initial commit, just going to make some basic history and then here's my file.

16
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,150
So I'll add read into that file and then I'll do a commit a form which just means add everything and

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,030
then end for message so I don't have to add and commit.

18
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,290
I'm going to just do this very quickly and I'll probably fast forward.

19
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,630
So this one will be at orange.

20
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,910
I'm just going to build up the rainbow one commit at a time.

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,070
Maybe I'll do yellow and green together.

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:28,770
So this let me clear will be add yellow and green and then blue and purple.

23
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,060
So I'll do the same thing right out of message and blue and purple.

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,070
OK, so we've got our rainbow set up now and I have a tiny bit of history.

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,920
I have what five commit so far.

26
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,070
OK, that's enough for us to start using get diff.

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,510
So the first version I showed you, the only version is just get diff with nothing else.

28
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,880
And this will show us all the changes in our working directory that are not staged for the next commit.

29
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,450
So it compares staging and the working directory.

30
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,240
Also staging is usually referred to the index on the documentation.

31
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,400
It's just confusing.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,570
Staging makes more sense.

33
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,870
So a lot of people say that right now, if I run it, there's no difference because there are no changes

34
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,320
at all.

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,690
There's nothing in the staging area.

36
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,200
There's nothing in the working directory.

37
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,580
Nothing has changed.

38
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:25,530
So if I instead do something simple like, well, what I did in the last video, if I remove purple.

39
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,250
Right.

40
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,130
And replace it as indigo.

41
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,470
Let's just save that if I type get status, we see, all right, there's something that's been modified

42
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,460
and now if I type get diff, we see an actual diff.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,400
So this is showing us a comparison between what the index knows about and what the staging area has

44
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,950
versus the changes that we've made.

45
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,830
Another way of thinking about it is that the differences are what we could tell it to add to the staging

46
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,160
area.

47
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,630
So as we see here in our colors, that text file right.

48
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,690
We're comparing one file to the next first version is a second version is B, so A is what the staging

49
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:12,450
area knows about versus B is the changes we have in our working directory.

50
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,170
So eg it's the minus sign, right.

51
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,290
B gets the plus sign.

52
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,730
So in the version of our files that the staging area last knew about purple was still there.

53
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,210
Right.

54
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,850
That, so that mine assignments versus with the version of the file that is actually in our working

55
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,850
directory, we see that Indigo has been added.

56
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,310
So that's what the plus indicates.

57
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,440
It doesn't always mean something is new, it just means that it came from file B and in our case, file

58
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,210
B are the new changes.

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,190
So that's all I'll show you in this video.

60
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,260
Just to make this point one more time, get Dev on its own will list the changes in our working directory

61
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,970
that are not staged.
