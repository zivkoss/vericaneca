00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,540
In this video, I'll introduce the get diff command and we'll also learn how to read, how to make sense

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,560
of its output, which can sometimes be a bit confusing when you're starting out.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,670
So they get diff command is all about showing changes in get so in a given repository.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:24,000
There are many situations where we might want to know what changed between the last comment and our

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,430
working directory, what's changed between the staging area and the working directory, what's changed

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,530
between two branches or two different files over a certain number of commits?

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:40,290
What's changed between what we have locally versus what's on GitHub, all these different scenarios

8
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,630
where we may want to learn about changes, about comparisons so they get diff command?

9
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:51,360
Does that the get diff command is powerful, but also sometimes a bit overwhelming when you're starting

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:51,660
out.

11
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,030
It doesn't do anything to the repository.

12
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,320
It doesn't impact anything just like git status and get log.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,660
It's purely an informative command.

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,210
So it's more about just taking a peek at changes and trying to understand how things have changed.

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,850
OK, so over here I've got a pretty large git repository.

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,240
I'll just show you there's a bunch of comments.

17
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,950
There's a decent number of files.

18
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,630
So lots of comments here, lots of files, html since he says some JavaScript and currently I haven't

19
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,950
changed anything since the last Kimmett right on Branch Master up to date.

20
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,510
OK, so then let's say I spend a couple of hours making some changes.

21
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,900
I'm going to fast forward, but I'll show you an example.

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,390
For whatever reason, I decide, you know what, I want this colour to be magenta and this other colour

23
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,170
should be to go a Cyane.

24
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,510
I'm just going to use like labelled named colours.

25
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,870
So they're easier to identify instead of, you know, this.

26
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,470
Let's do Korrell there anyway.

27
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,880
I'll make a bunch of changes.

28
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,390
Maybe I'll also change some HTML.

29
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:03,510
So in this HTML page, I'm going to change this one to say hey there and then down at the bottom I'll

30
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:09,420
make a paragraph and just says chicken's all right.

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,940
And then I go to this JavaScript file grid.

32
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:12,920
Yes.

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,270
And somewhere maybe in the middle I'm going to print out a happy face.

34
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:28,970
OK, and then back in a ceasefire, I changed some font size from 35 pixels to 65 pixels and let's say

35
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,480
I do a whole bunch more, but this is just enough for this demonstration.

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,740
And I then realized, you know what, I should probably make a commitment.

37
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,810
I don't remember exactly what I did in each of those files.

38
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:47,240
So if I just go back and look at this file, it's not immediately clear what's changed unless I memorized

39
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,580
or I exactly know what the file looked like, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly where things changed

40
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,900
across these three files.

41
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,210
So that's where DIFC comes in.

42
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,490
The first usage of git diff.

43
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,360
It's just get spaced diff without any additional options.

44
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,550
And this will list all the changes in our working directory that are not staged for the next commit.

45
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,570
So it compares the staging area and our working directory.

46
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,100
So I'll show you an example.

47
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,850
Currently I have not staged anything for comments, right.

48
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,960
If I type status.

49
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,770
We see that there are three modifications, three different files, none of them staged, and if I run

50
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,060
this, get diff command.

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,460
We see this kind of crazy looking output's, it's another one of these windows where I'm not actually

52
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,390
in my terminal, I have to.

53
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,090
Well, I guess I am, but I have to escape this view by typing queue, just like with jet lag.

54
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,220
So, anyway, I see all of this and it's a little bit crazy looking at first.

55
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,560
We see some of the stuff that changed.

56
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,470
We see some red, some green minus and pluses.

57
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:57,880
But then what is this is at signed negative 25 comma seven minus minus minus plus plus plus.

58
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,140
It's all this stuff.

59
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,270
I mean, it's just kind of crazy looking, but this is the output of get diff.

60
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,850
So what I'm going to do in the next video is walk you through how to read this, how to make sense of

61
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:15,970
what's going on here, what's this line doing, what's the minus and the plus mean and all that stuff

62
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,780
that's coming up.

63
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,760
But this is just an introduction to the concept.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,470
You make a bunch of changes, then you want to try and understand more about what those changes were.

65
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,330
And this is one use case.

66
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,050
Forget dif.

67
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,420
We just don't really know how to make sense of it yet.

68
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,590
So that's the next video.
